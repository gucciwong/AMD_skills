# AMD Skills

> **This is an independent community fork of [amd/skills](https://github.com/amd/skills).**
>
> It is **not** maintained by AMD and is **not** staged for merge-back. Upstream's
> `CONTRIBUTING.md` limits contributions to "AMD engineers and selected partners",
> so measured findings from ordinary consumer hardware are published here instead.
>
> **What this fork adds:**
>
> | Addition | What it is |
> |---|---|
> | [`skills/picking-amd-gpu-backend`](skills/picking-amd-gpu-backend) | New skill: picks a GPU backend that actually installs, then verifies the work landed on the discrete GPU |
> | [`skills/local-ai-use/hardware-notes.md`](skills/local-ai-use/hardware-notes.md) | Measured results on a consumer AMD dGPU, including the negative ones |
>
> Both come from an end-to-end run on a Radeon RX 7600M XT (gfx1102, 8 GB,
> Thunderbolt eGPU) under Windows 11. Raw data, scripts, and the experiments that
> produced wrong answers before they produced right ones live in
> [amd-local-ai-bench](https://github.com/gucciwong/amd-local-ai-bench).
>
> **Caveat:** every number comes from one GPU on one machine, and the Linux
> guidance in these additions follows upstream documentation without being tested.
>
> Everything below this line is upstream's README, unchanged.

[**Browse the Skill Catalog ->**](#the-catalog)

</div>

AMD Skills provide agents with knowledge, scripts, and conventions for working with AMD hardware and software.

Skills in this repository follow the standardized [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) format and are designed to interoperate with the major coding agents like Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini CLI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tech Preview:** We’re building the catalog in the open, sharing progress as the foundations take shape. Expect frequent changes as skills, categories, and descriptions evolve.



## Installation

Install AMD Skills with the [`skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) via `npx`. No clone or manual copying required.

```bash
npx skills add amd/skills
```

This prompts you to pick a skill and an install destination. To install a specific skill into specific agents, pass `--skill` with one or more `--agent` flags (e.g. `cursor`, `claude-code`, `codex`):

```bash
npx skills add amd/skills --skill local-ai-use --agent claude-code
```

Browse everything available before installing:

```bash
npx skills add amd/skills --list
```

Please note that `npx` requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Prefer to do it by hand? See [Manual installation](#manual-installation).

## Using a skill

Once a skill is installed, reference it in plain language while talking to your agent. For example:

- "Use AMD Skills to learn how to generate images locally instead of burning cloud tokens."
- "Use AMD Skills to deploy this LLM for inference on my AMD Instinct GPUs."

In most cases the agent picks the right skill on its own from the description; explicit invocation is a fallback, not a requirement.

For hands-on, step-by-step guides that show a skill in action, see the [walkthroughs](walkthroughs/README.md).

## The catalog

The initial catalog is organized into three focus areas, spanning the full stack from client to cloud. This catalog is expected to grow significantly as more skills land.

### Client-Native

Run and optimize on Ryzen AI.

| Skill | What it does | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`local-ai-use`](skills/local-ai-use/SKILL.md) | Route image generation, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text through a local AI server to reduce token cost. | in-repo |
| [`local-ai-app-integration`](skills/local-ai-app-integration/SKILL.md) | Integrate local AI into cloud LLM apps for offline support, better privacy, and lower API costs. | in-repo |
| `apu-memory-tuner` | Inspect and tune the shared-vs-dedicated memory split (GTT / UMA Frame Buffer) on AMD Ryzen APUs. | _planned_ |

### Cross-Stack

Cross-stack skills, from client to cloud.

| Skill | What it does | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rocm-doctor` | Diagnose ROCm / PyTorch / llama.cpp failures on AMD GPUs against a fixed list of known misconfigurations. | _planned_ |
| `hyperloom-kernel-optimizer` | Autonomously optimizes LLM inference on AMD GPUs. | _planned_ |
| `vllm-semantic-router` | Setup a vLLM router that semantically maps your request to the best available platform. | _planned_ |
| `hrr-replay-analysis` | Record, replay, and analyze GPU workload behavior on ROCm across AMD Instinct, Radeon, and Ryzen hardware using HIP Record and Replay archives. | _planned_ |

### Server-Native

Run and optimize on AMD Instinct.

| Skill | What it does | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`serving-llms-on-instinct`](skills/serving-llms-on-instinct/SKILL.md) | Deploy LLM inference on AMD Instinct GPUs end-to-end: detect hardware (or onboard via AMD Developer Cloud), validate model fit, apply the right vLLM recipe, and launch a benchmarked endpoint. SGLang and engine/backend selection in later phases. | in-repo |
| [`serving-llms-on-epyc`](skills/serving-llms-on-epyc/SKILL.md) | Serve LLMs on AMD EPYC CPUs with vLLM + zentorch, in a container (Docker/Podman) or conda. Handles CPU detection, runtime/env validation, vLLM model-support and RAM-fit checks, hardware-sized threads/KV, launch, and health verification. Single instance; reports and stops on failure. | in-repo |
| [`magpie-kernel-evaluator`](skills/magpie-kernel-evaluator/SKILL.md) | Evaluate GPU kernel correctness and performance, compare kernel implementations, and benchmark vLLM / SGLang inference with profiling, TraceLens, and torch-trace gap analysis. | [Magpie](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Magpie) |
| [`tracelens-analysis-orchestrator`](skills/tracelens-analysis-orchestrator/SKILL.md) | Orchestrate modular PyTorch profiler trace analysis with TraceLens: generate perf reports, run system-level and compute-kernel subagents in parallel, and write a prioritized stakeholder report. | [TraceLens](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/TraceLens) |

## What is a skill?

A skill is a self-contained folder that bundles everything an agent needs to perform a focused task: instructions, helper scripts, prompts, templates, and references. At its core is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter, a `name`, and a short `description` that tells the agent *when* the skill should activate, followed by the guidance the agent reads while the skill is in use.

```
skills/
  rocm-doctor/
    SKILL.md
    skill-card.md
    scripts/
    references/
```

When an agent decides a skill is relevant (or you invoke it explicitly), it loads that `SKILL.md` and follows the instructions inside. Descriptions stay in context cheaply; the full body of a skill only loads when the task actually matches.

Every skill also ships a `skill-card.md`: a short, human-facing governance card (Description, Owner, License) that tells a reviewer what the skill is and who stands behind it without reading the source. See [docs/skill-cards.md](docs/skill-cards.md).

## Why a skill, not a doc?

Documentation describes an API surface: every flag, every option, neutral by design. A skill encodes the opinionated path: which flags, which container image, which `gfx` target, which environment variables, in what order. It captures the decisions a senior AMD engineer makes without thinking, in a form the agent can apply consistently across teams and repositories.

Skills earn their keep on repeated, opinionated workflows, exactly where the AMD stack lives.


## A federated catalog

The AMD stack is large and moves fast. ROCm, HIP, Ryzen AI, and framework integrations each have their own team, release cadence, and validation matrix. So skills here are **federated**: each skill is owned and versioned by the team that owns the product it describes, and this repository is the catalog that brings them together.

```

This repo also acts as an **incubator**: a skill can start under `skills/` to iterate quickly, then graduate to its product repo and be re-pointed from `.github/scripts/sources.yml` once it has a clear owner, with no change for installed users.

```
skills/                  # All skills the agent can load
docs/                    # Long-form documentation (e.g. skill-cards.md)
.claude-plugin/          # Claude Code marketplace manifest
.cursor-plugin/          # Cursor marketplace manifest (generated)
.codex-plugin/           # Codex plugin manifest (generated)
.agents/plugins/         # Codex repo marketplace catalog (generated)
plugin-metadata.json     # Vendor-neutral identity/discovery metadata
.github/workflows/       # CI for validating skills
.github/scripts/         # Internal repo scripts
.github/scripts/sources.yml  # External skill sources for federation
```

In-repo skills are authored directly under `skills/`. Federated skills are
declared in [`.github/scripts/sources.yml`](.github/scripts/sources.yml) and vendored into
`skills/` by the manually-dispatched `import-external-skills` workflow,
which opens a pull request with the imported copies. Each vendored skill
carries a `.federated.json` marker that records the upstream repo and
pinned commit, so the importer can refresh or remove it without disturbing
in-repo skills.

## Manual Installation

Until marketplace integration lands, install skills manually: clone this repo, then copy (or symlink) the skill folders you want from `skills/` into your agent's skills directory. Each agent discovers `SKILL.md` automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amd/skills.git amd-skills
cp -r amd-skills/skills/local-ai-use <agent-skills-dir>/
```

| Agent | Skills directory (personal / project) |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` / `.cursor/skills/` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` / `.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `$HOME/.agents/skills` / `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills` |

## Contributing a skill

We welcome contributions from AMD engineers and selected partners. Two paths, matching how the catalog is organized:

- **Path A: In-repo skills.** Authored directly under `skills/`. Best for cross-cutting workflows without a natural product home.
- **Path B: Product-repo skills.** Authored in a product repository and registered here through [`.github/scripts/sources.yml`](.github/scripts/sources.yml) with a pinned tag. Best for skills that should ship and version with a specific product.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions and the rules CI enforces.
